# Hans Portfolio

## Introduction
This is a simple static website which use `Sass` and `jQuery` to set up. To the beginning, I just want to use [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/forty/) to construct all content, however, a special error let me give up which the `jpg` file could not be loaded correctly even thought I have checked the link by Google Development Tool.

## Planning
As for a personal portfolio website, I will go on try use new technology like `Netlify` and others to maintain my website.
